        <li>cooking oil</li> 
    </ol>
    <i>Steps</i>
    <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Potatoes:

        Wash and peel the potatoes.
        Cut them into even-sized strips (about 1/4 inch thick for classic fries)</li>
    <li>Soak the Potatoes:

        Place the potato strips in a bowl of cold water for 30 minutes.
        This removes excess starch, making the chips crispier.</li>
    <li>Cook the Eggs:

        Pour the whisked eggs into the pan.
        Let them sit for a few seconds without stirring.</li>
    <li>Dry the Potatoes:

        Drain the soaked potatoes and pat them completely dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.</li>
    <li>Fry the Chips (Twice):

        Heat oil in a deep pan or fryer to about 150°C (300°F).
        Fry the potato strips in batches for 5–7 minutes until soft but not browned.
        Remove and drain on paper towels. Increase the oil temperature to 180°C (350°F) and fry the potatoes again until golden and crispy</li>
    <li>Season and Serve:

        Remove the chips from the oil and drain them on fresh paper towels.
        Sprinkle with salt (or your favorite seasoning) while they're still hot. Serve immediately.</li>
