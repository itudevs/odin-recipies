    <i>Steps</i>
    <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Ingredients:

        Crack 2â€“3 eggs into a bowl.
        Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.
        Whisk the eggs until well combined.</li>
    <li>Heat the Pan:

        Place a non-stick pan over medium heat.
        Add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the surface.</li>
    <li>Cook the Eggs:

        Pour the whisked eggs into the pan.
        Let them sit for a few seconds without stirring.</li>
    <li>Stir Gently:

        Use a spatula or wooden spoon to gently stir and fold the eggs.
        Keep stirring occasionally to create soft curds.</li>
    <li>Remove from Heat:

        Once the eggs are slightly undercooked (still shiny but not runny), remove the pan from heat.
        The residual heat will finish cooking them.</li>
    <li>Serve and Enjoy:

        Transfer the eggs to a plate and serve immediately.
        Optionally, garnish with fresh herbs like chives or parsley.</li>
