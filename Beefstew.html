    <i>Steps</i>
    <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Ingredients:

        Dice the onions, carrots, and tomatoes.
        Crumble the beef cube into a small bowl for later use.</li>
    <li>Preheat the Potjie Pot:

        Place your potjie pot over medium heat on an open flame or stovetop.
        Add a bit of oil or butter to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Brown the Beef:

        Add the beef chunks to the pot and brown them on all sides. This helps seal in the flavor.</li>
    <li>Add Onions and Carrots:

        Toss in the onions and carrots. Sauté them with the beef for 5–7 minutes until softened.</li>
    <li>Incorporate the Tomatoes:

        Stir in the diced tomatoes. Let them cook down to form a rich base for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Season and Add Beef Cube:

        Add the crumbled beef cube and stir well. This will enhance the depth of the flavors.</li>
    <li>Pour in Worcestershire Sauce:

        Add a generous splash of Worcestershire sauce (adjust to taste). Stir to coat all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Simmer Slowly:

            Lower the heat and cover the pot. Let it simmer gently for about 1.5–2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Check and Adjust:

            Periodically check the potjie. If it's too dry, add a splash of water or beef stock. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy:

            Once the beef is tender and flavors are well combined, serve your Beef Potjie hot with rice, bread, or pap (traditional South African porridge).</li>
